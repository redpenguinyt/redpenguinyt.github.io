hi! This is a website for all my projects and stuff

you can find the website [here](https://redpengu.in/)

to host the website locally:
1. install `bundler` and `jekyll` with your package manager of choice or use the environment provided by `flake.nix` by running `nix develop`
2. run `bundle install` to install all necessary gems
3. run `bundler exec jekyll serve` to start the server

`assets/fonts/` contains the <https://nerdfonts.com/> webfont, which is licensed under the MIT software license. a copy of their license is included alongside the font files
